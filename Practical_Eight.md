# Week Nine - Practical Eight

## Learning Activities

The learning activity this week was to create a learning experiment to reflect on past study techniques and test new ones that might be able to improve the method and result of learning. In the past, I've had some trouble with procrastination and trying to focus on a task at hand. So for my learning experiment this week, I decided to test using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro technique is the act of focusing on a single task for 25 minutes and then taking a 5 minute break. Repeating the process two or three times before having a longer break. For my experiment, I decided to test it with completing practical tasks for another assessment (Game Engine and Simulation practicals), using the Pomodoro Timer.

The theory going into the learning experiment is that: Using the Pomodoro technique should allow for more tasks to be finished effeciently without distraction from outside sources.

The test: Using the Pomodoro technique to complete this week's practical tasks which consist of three major sections (usually taking 1 hour each in previous weeks.)

## Estimated Hours

~3 hours

## Content Insights

In previous weeks, it could take me about forty-five minutes to an hour to finish each section of the tutorial (practicals are split up into a number of sections covering each concept of the work.) This is pretty consistent across most practicals completed this semester, so I thought that would make for a good control time. After conducting the test, which was employing the Pomodoro technique to complete the exercises this week, there was a noticable average improvement. Over the three different sections, the average time it took to complete exercises was reduced to about half an hour. I was able to focus on the task without distractions and gained a better understanding of the content being delivered. It also gave incentive to complete the tasks, as I wasn't feeling the pressure of needing to finish things while I had the small breaks.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Breaking larger projects into smaller tasks and using the Pomodoro technique can be highly beneficial from a career and employability perspective. Here are a few reasons why:

1. Increases productivity: By breaking down the larger project into smaller tasks, you can increase your productivity which is essential to all career projects. It's a skill that is highly valued by employers and will overall improve the quality of your work.

2. Effective Time Management: By allowing you to work on tasks for a set amount of time before taking a break you can better avoid burnout. This skill is highly valued by employers, as it enables you to prioritize tasks, complete work efficiently, and maintain focus over extended periods.

3. Enhances focus and concentration: As with productivity, breaking the project into smaller tasks and dedicating periods of time to enhanced focus will allow the employee to provide higher quality work. This would reflect positively on both the employee and the reputation of the employer.

4. Improves planning and organization skills: Breaking down a project into smaller tasks requires planning and organization skills, which is something that many employers seek with potential new employees. Being able to effectively plan and organize your work can help you meet deadlines and achieve your goals.

Overall, breaking down larger projects into smaller tasks and using the Pomodoro technique can help you become a more productive, focused, and organized employee, which can enhance your career and employability.
