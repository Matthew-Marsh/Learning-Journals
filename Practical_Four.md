# Week Four - Practical Three

(Just as a note, I'm still recovering from being in hospital with a severe back injury. So bear with me.)

## Learning Activities

The learning goal that I focused on this week was exploring the use of Docker and other platforms that use containerization such as Portainer. I also spent time learning more about the Ghost CMS and the benefits that it provides for web developers.

## Content Insights

Through my individual learning, I learned about the importance of containerisation and the essential role it plays in modern development and deployment. Containerisation allows teams to create an isolated development environment to work in without the need to install packages or dependencies outside of the container environment. It also makes it easier to deploy to hosting services, allowing the developer to deploy the containerised images (such as Linux/Ubuntu and WordPress) to systems that support it.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Containerisation through platforms such as Docker and Portainer will inevitably become a large part of the web development industry. This means that skills in these areas will prove to be beneficial when it comes to apply for web development jobs. I believe that employers will be looking for potential hires that are well versed in the use of containers, especially companies such as AWS that employ them regularly.

It would also give people the opportunity to work in different development environments, such as Linux, without posing any risk to their personal machines as the container keeps the distributable isolated within its own version of a virtual machine. The skills that I believe Docker will allow people to gain, will be valuable when it comes to progressing their careers within the web development industry.
