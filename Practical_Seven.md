# Week Eight - Practical Seven

## Learning Activities

Continued trying to understand the CI/CD workflow and pipelines. This week focused on the possibility of working with an open source platform called Jenkins. Jenkins is capable of creating automated tasks and pipelines that allow developers to do a number of tasks, one of which is pulling changes from a Github repo to a live server.

## Content Insights

The most honest insight I can say that I made this week, after an extensive amount of hours spent working on trying to develop backend connections is that simple projects don't really need a team of mulitple people to create. Much of the time is spent trying to reconfigure mistakes that someone else has made that has started to affect your work. "Too many cooks, spoil the broth" as it were. So I also learned that sometimes, you need to compromise and shift to another task in a group project.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I believe that learning to work as a team is one of the fundamental cores of working in any industry, especially ones focused around design such as Information Technology. But there is also value in learning to work independently, and knowing when it's becoming a detriment to the process if you continue to stubbornly assert your position in the team. This is where having skills in adaptability become extremely valuable to a career in any industry.

The ability for someone to adapt to the situation, restructure their workflows or even completely shift perspective to another aspect of the project ends up being a valuable asset and highly sought after quality for many employers. But there's a distinct difference between abandoning your work and reconsidering. The willingness to work through a difficulty, rather than give up at the first sign of a hurdle is skill only learned through experience.

In the IT industry, the need for collaboration and teamwork cannot be overstated. However, recognizing when it's appropriate to work alone or with a smaller team is equally important. By doing so, IT professionals can be more efficient, effective, and successful in their projects.
