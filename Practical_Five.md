# Week Five - Practical Five

## Learning Activities

This week was quite hectic for both my study and personal life. The learning goal this week was simple, learn how Wordpress handles child themes and how you would be able to access the theme folders in a running docker container.

## Content Insights

The insight that I had for this week, was that it is easier to access the files locally on a running docker container than it would be on a live site. While this may seem like an obvious insight, the level of difficulty was the main focus. Originally, before undertaking the personal study, I thought that the process would be complicated and technical. However, it seemed relatively easy to create a docker-compose that enables the developer to make changes and review them in a local environment. The next stage of my personal study will be understanding how this would be accomplished in a live environment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

One insight that I had this week that is applicable to career and employability is the importance of gaining practical skills and knowledge in the field of web development. Specifically, I realized that it is often easier to access files and make changes locally on a running docker container than it is on a containerised live server.

This realization not only demonstrates the value of hands-on experience, but also highlights the importance of staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and trends within the industry. By acquiring practical skills like creating a docker-compose and understanding how to review changes in a local environment, individuals can set themselves apart from their peers and increase their employability.

However, it's important to note that there is still more to learn beyond local environments, and individuals should strive to understand how to apply their skills in a live environment to further enhance their career prospects. While local environments are good for quick editing and testing, the developer still needs to learn how to import their work to a live environment or utilising CD/CI processes.
