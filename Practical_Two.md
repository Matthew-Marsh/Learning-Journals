# Week Three - Practical Two

## Learning Activities

This week I looked into Content Management Systems available and their viability for the present and the future. I looked into content management systems such
as Ghost, Drupal and a few others and which hosting sites would be most applicable. I also looked at how you would be able to customise the CMS templates, specifically in Joomla.

## Content Insights

After researching content management systems, I noticed that there were a lot available. This made the research more difficult to nail down exactly what would be the best suited to the task at hand. Another insight I had was that many CMS, while providing simple to use tools for regular users to create their websites, were difficult to customise to a developer's standards. In testing, I found it more difficult to change an existing CMS template than to simply do it with HTML, CSS or even some Javascript frameworks.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In terms of employability, using content management systems may look favourable for companies that don't have an invested interest in creating complex and diverse websites. For example, a physical store looking to get involved in online retail would be happy with using a system such as 'Shopify', for its quick turnaround on developing websites and having them hosted.

Otherwise, I feel that it would be more valuable to learn the skills needed for intricate web development. Not only would this skills prove useful for developing websites better catered towards the client, they would be transferrable to other areas of website development. Someone who has experience with other frameworks would be able to work with CMS and regular website development compared to those that only have the ability to use CMS.

Personally, I feel that learning the stacks individually (front-end, back-end, and databases) would be more valuable in the future.
