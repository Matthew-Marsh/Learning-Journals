## Content Insights

When interviewing potential teammates for the web development project, it seemed important to assess not just their technical skills, but also their ability to collaborate and communicate effectively. This was easier given previous work history with the people interviewed. I think we should look for individuals who have a passion for web development, but also look for those who have experience working in teams and can explain how they have contributed and how important their role was. Ask about their approach to problem-solving and how they handle conflicts within a team. Lastly, I think we should be sure to evaluate their willingness to learn and adapt to the web development process.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In terms of employability, being able to conduct effective interviews allows you to gather information on a person, assess their skills and qualifications, and make informed hiring decisions. It also helps you build strong relationships with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders by improving your communication and interpersonal skills.

Being able to interview effectively will provide transferrable skills to other aspects of your career and make you more employable as a whole. Such areas as negotiating projects and contracts, for example, would benefit from the communication skills built through interviewing potential teammates or hiring candidates.

Overall, I think the skills provided by working on interviewing skills would prove to be valuable in any career, which would help you network, ake informed decisions, and ultimately achieve your goals.
