# Week Two - Practical One

## Learning Activities

The practical this week was to create a very basic static website using html and css. I also decided to explore the use of Bootstrap, having had no previous experience before which mean finding resources that would assist in the learning process.

## Resources/Links

[Bootstrap 5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/)\
[Bootstrap 5 examples - MD Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com)\
[W3 Schools - Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/)\

## Estimated Hours

~5 hours to build the website while looking into how to build the individual components in Bootstrap.

## Content Insights

Having had some experience with html and css in the past, I had the general foundational understanding needed to complete the task. After spending the previous couple of months working with Vue/Vite, it was a good re-introduction to the basics. Learning Bootstrap, while little frustrating at times (especially when trying to customise aspect of the components), provided an interesting challenge that I hadn't previously faced and by achieving my goals I feel that I gained new experience and understanding in its use.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Html and CSS are the basic building blocks of website development and widely used within the IT industry. Skills in these two languages could look favourable when trying to apply for a web development job.\

In addition to the basics, Bootstrap is a tool often used by professionals to quickly develop basic websites, either because complex sites are unneeded or to provide conceptual design for their clients. Having the skills and understanding of the way Bootstrap can be employed to complete a job would also be favourable to potential employers in the future.

As someone with a keen interest in web development and programming, I believe that these skills could be beneficial to my future in the IT industry.
