# Week Seven - Practical Six

## Learning Activities

This week's learning activity was to figure out the DevOps workflow. Specifically, I focused on CI/CD and using GitHub actions to automate the process of deploying the various developments created from a local environment to a containerised or server hosted WordPress website.

## Content Insights

The insight that I had for this week, was that it was important to properly set out a GitHub repository to better suit the chosen workflow. There are three main branching strategies that can be employed that would dictate the workflow, Git Flow, GitHub Flow, and GitLab Flow. This is mostly about how you organise your repository branches to allow for CI/CD development. Based on the branching strategy that the team uses, the GitHub actions could be set up so that any developed code could automatically be pushed to the dedicated live server environment. I.e. Staging branch pushed to a Staging server environment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Having a solid understanding of version control systems, specifically Git and GitHub, is becoming increasingly important for software development careers and working in a team environment. Knowing how to properly set up a GitHub repository and employ an appropriate branching strategy can greatly optimise the workflow for team development and ease some of the burden of manually trying to deploy changes to a live site.

Familiarity with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), such as using GitHub Actions, could make a potential new employee more attractive to employers in the web development industry. Being able to automate the deployment of code changes to staging and production environments is a valuable skill that can save time and increase efficiency in website development projects. Professionals in the industry looking to pursue a career in web development should focus on gaining knowledge and practical experience in Git, GitHub, and CI/CD workflows as they are sure to be valuable.
